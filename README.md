# Minecraft Refill Practice (MRP)
A simple JFrame application to practice refilling soups/pots. Supports JDK 1.8 and above.

## Purpose
This is another one of my "bored" projects, basically whenever i'm bored I just make whatever that comes to mind.

## Usage
Using this app is pretty easy if you know what you are doing, and doesn't have too many features or settings to mess with.
We currently detect 2 methods, which are **shift clicking and dropping**.
The goal is to get the fastest time, and when you are done refilling items it will show you a "results" window.
In this results window, it tells you:
 - Duration (ms)
 - Lowest time between refills (ms)
 - Highest time between refills (ms)
 - Average time between refills (ms)
 - Refill Method
 - Amount of soups/pots refilled

It also opens a window with the inventory image in the background and soups correctly place to fully "emulate" minecraft's inventory.

I may update this later on for improvements and more.
